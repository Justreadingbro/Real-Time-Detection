# Real-Time-Detection
This repository contains a ready-to-run project that performs real-time object detection on a webcam (or video file) and streams the annotated video over the local network (so you can open it on your phone). The pipeline uses Ultralytics YOLOv8 for detection and Flask to stream frames as an MJPEG feed.
